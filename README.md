Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

#### Topics learnt/explored
* JSON parsing to a model object
* Design an activity layout
* Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
